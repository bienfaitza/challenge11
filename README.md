# challenge 11(UFOs)


## Purpose
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
 
## Overview 
The request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website.  The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website. 

## Results:
### Welcome to UFO Sightings! 


### How the filters appear when first landing on the page:

### How the filters appear after being used: 
By typing in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters, the result returns 2 matches.

## Summary: 

### Drawback:
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search.  Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive.  The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end.  The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "elcajon", “el cajon_”, or "El Cajon".  The only acceptable input would be "el cajon".
